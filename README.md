# DriverPass

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

  For this project I created multiple UML diagrams for a the client "DriverPass".  They required system design documents for a standard LMS (learning management system).

What did you do particularly well?

I feel I excelled most in creating the class diagrams with lucidchart.  I think my strengths lean towards implementation and software design rather than use case and activity diagrams.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think I would focus on improving my ability to create use case diagrams.  I would improve this by looking at references and reading literature on best practices when creating these types of UML's.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the users needs by reading the transcribed customer meetings.  This allowed me to consider carefully exactly what the owner of DriverPass wanted and implement it.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Typically I approach designing software by asking the customer questions, providing suggestions, designing the overall class structure, then writing code and refactoring iteratively.  I think I may implement some use case diagrams into my design pattern.  It should be beneficial when creating RESTful software.
